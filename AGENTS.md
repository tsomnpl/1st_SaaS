# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Cloud Agent

PostgreSQL 16 is part of the environment image. The start command launches it, creates the local `flyermint` role and database, applies `npx prisma migrate deploy`, then seeds plans.

Local database URL, written into `.env` when `DATABASE_URL` is empty:

`postgresql://flyermint@127.0.0.1:5432/flyermint`

`npm run dev` serves the app on port 3000. Public pages and `/api/health` run without Clerk, Rodium, or Money Fusion keys. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before filling those keys. `prisma/seed.mjs` must stay plain JavaScript: `npm run db:seed` executes it with Node, while `npx prisma db seed` loads `.env` first.
